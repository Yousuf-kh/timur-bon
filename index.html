				<h2>The beginning of the sweet life</h2>
				<p>
				Bon! is a family business. In 2005, we opened the Italian cafe Il Perfetto, and this is where our restaurant business began.
                Then we were inspired by the French theme. We thought that Uzbekistan lacks European coffee shops and especially real coffee.
                At that time, almost everywhere only sold 3 in 1 instant coffee, so we decided to offer real coffee. So, in 2009, the first French coffee shop Bon opened! on Chekhov street. It took about $150 thousand to launch the first point.
                Initially, it was a very small coffee shop, and we reinvested all the income from it. Later we had the opportunity to expand. A lot of money was spent on equipment; we brought it from Italy. Three years ago I returned to Tashkent to manage the Bon! Before that, I lived and studied in the UK for 15 years, where I opened my own restaurant, which is still operating, but in Uzbekistan I saw great potential.
				In the UK, everyone knows how to do business; there is a lot of competition and little room for development. In our country, not everyone knows yet what can be expected from the market, what technologies can be introduced.
				How the network of establishments developed
				Premises on Chekhov Street. It was a very convenient location, so the first Bon point opened here! New establishments gradually appeared: on Shota Rustaveli, Chimkentskaya streets and so on. <br> <br>There were more and more guests, and we tried to launch closer to them.Now we have 11 branches in Tashkent, and we are planning to open soon in Fergana, Andijan, Samarkand and Bukhara. Until recently, we could launch approximately one point per year, but now all this will be much faster, since we have established a system within the company.
				We have a kind of checklist for choosing the next location; first of all, we need to determine where exactly we see ourselves. We carefully study the new place: how many cars are passing, how many people are passing by, we calculate the square footage of the room, and so on.Сарафанное радио — лучшая реклама
				Мы долгое время почти не рекламировались. Активное продвижение началось в 2018 году, когда ЕБРР предложили нам сотрудничество. Мы стали одной из первых компаний в Узбекистане, с которыми банк заключил прямые кредитные договора.
				Сарафанное радио — главный инструмент продвижения. Причем, не только в нашей сфере, но и в целом по Узбекистану. Люди здесь доверяют друг другу больше, чем в Европе.Почти вся продукция для Bon! производится в Бектемире. Раньше все продукты готовились в самих филиалах, но там стало тесно, и мы не могли производить их в нужном объеме.
